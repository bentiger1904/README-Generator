The task was to create a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using Inquirer package

## User story

AS A developer
I WANT a README generator
SO THAT I can quickly create a professional README for a new project

## It's done when:

A command-line application accepts user input.
When a user is prompted for information about the application repository, a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with:

The title of my project

Sections entitled:

- Description
- Installation
- Usage
- License
- Contributing
- Tests
- Questions

When a user enters the project title, it's displayed as the title of the README.

When a user enters a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions, this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests.

When a user enters their GitHub username, it's added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to their GitHub profile.

When a user enters their email address, it's added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach them with additional questions.
